# Privacy Policy for Mahi Bridge

**Effective Date:** 16/05/2025

_Mahi Bridge_ is a Chrome extension designed to help Scouts Aotearoa (Scouts NZ) group treasurers compare member records between **Mahi Tahi** and **Xero**. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

### Mahi Tahi Data

You manually upload a CSV export from Mahi Tahi. This file is **processed entirely within your browser** and is **never sent or stored anywhere outside your device**.

### Xero Data

Mahi Bridge connects to Xero using the official **Xero API** with your authorization. The extension reads contact information necessary for comparison.

- Xero data is used **only during the active session** and is **not stored or transmitted elsewhere**.

## 2. No Third-Party Access

Mahi Bridge does **not use any third-party services or analytics tools**. The only external service it connects to is **Xero**, and only with your explicit consent.

## 3. Local Processing Only

All data — from both Mahi Tahi and Xero — is processed **locally in your browser**.

- No data is sent to external servers or stored remotely.
- All data is discarded when your session ends, unless you manually save output.

## 4. Security and User Responsibility

Because all processing happens on your device, you maintain full control over your information. It is your responsibility to:

- Keep your browser and device secure.
- Protect your Xero credentials and API authorizations.

## 5. User Consent

By using Mahi Bridge, you consent to:

- Uploading a Mahi Tahi CSV for local processing.
- Authorizing access to Xero contacts via the Xero API.
- Local-only comparison of this data within your browser session.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be included in future versions of the extension. Please review this policy periodically for changes.
